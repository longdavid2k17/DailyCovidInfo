# DailyCovidInfo
My first Spring Web app, informs in Polish about confirmed victims of COVID-19 and confirmed deaths. I based on few tutorials of Spring Boot, some examples and my JAVA and HTML/CSS knowlege. To get data for the app , I got it from those links:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
and
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv

For now it gets static data for 11th April 2020, I have to made little method getting data and updates it.
